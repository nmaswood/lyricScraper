On the Hogwarts Express with Crabbe, Goyle, Pansy Chillin' out, maxin, compartment 3B Well, it was too much to expect privacy 'Specially with a reject like our friend, Harry That's when I started talking about Voldemort 'Cause I was explaining my sweet new posish Thought I saw a shoe or a small piece of fish No, it was a shoe that my two eyes did see Under a cloak of invisibility Just then a thought started creeping up on me I knew exactly what I'd do Make you wish you acted more quickly And that I'd never seen your shoe  I'm gonna kick you in the face I might do it twenty seven times just in case I know nothing could ever replace The picture in my mind of your kicked-in face  After they left I went through with my plan And tied a tight knot around each of your hands Made you listen to Stryper and "Enter Sandman" Made you hear "Rio" by Duran Duran You didn't like it, what is wrong with you?  That made me angry, I was so upset I kicked you so hard that your pants you did wet You looked like somebody took a small baby Stuck it in a blender and turned on puree   I just kicked you in the face Hey, Harry Potter, how does your blood taste? I know nothing could ever replace The picture in my mind of your kicked-in face  I just kicked you in the face Hey, Mr. Potter, how does your blood taste? I know nothing could ever replace The picture in my mind of your kicked-in face The picture in my mind of your kicked-in face

You and I in a little magic shop Buy some Chocolate Frogs with the money we've got Set them free but they don't last long, They're good for one jump, then they're done At the base of my spine I get a tingling sense Something evil is about to commence Under cover of a darkened sky, 99 Death Eaters go by  99 Death Eaters Under cover of a darkened sky The Ministry's on red alert There's something here from somewhere else The Aurors all spring to life Moody opens up his eye And focusing it on the sky As 99 Death Eaters go by  99 Decision Street 99 Ministers meet To worry, worry, super scurry Call Dementors in a hurry This is what we've waited for This is it boys, this is war Cornelius Fudge is on the line As 99 Death Eaters go by  99 Knights of the Air Ride their magic Firebolts Everyone's a superhero Everyone's a Ludo Bagman The goal is to identify, Clarify, and classify Scramble in a darkened sky As 99 Death Eaters go by 99 Death Eaters go by  99 dreams I have had The Dark Mark's floating in the air It's all over and I'm standing pretty In what used to be this city If I could find something tragic, Just to prove there once was magic And here is a Chocolate Frog I think of you and let it go

They're making movies about my years at Hogwarts And they had to pick just the right one To represent me On the silver screen And I've gotta say they've got it spot on  'Cause he's a swell guy we all like a lot And he's got it going on with those baby blues he's got And even though I'm straight I'm not ashamed to say Tom Felton's kinda hot

 Tom Felton's Kinda Hot







The Sorting Hat said, 'Slytherin could make you great.' But you pleaded with him: 'No' And I think that was a big mistake 'Cause kindness can only get you so far And I don't believe it was love that created your scar It was the will to live Oh, Harry, why won't you be my friend?  The first day at Hogwarts I offered you my hand But you refused it, why, I just don't understand 'Cause you left me no choice but to Insult all the people that you chose to stand next to You make me look like a jerk Do you think that you're better than me? Well that hurts  Why wont you shake my hand? Why wont you shake my hand? Why wont you shake my hand, Harry Potter?   Here we go! Why wont you shake my hand? Why wont you shake my hand? Why wont you shake my hand, Harry Potter?

I don't think it's fair That you are the youngest Seeker in years I really don't care That you caught the stupid Remembrall This year things'll be much different, you see Because my father really came through for me And now my teammates and I all can say: Gryffindor better bow down to the Slytherin way  'Cause I got a broomstick, it's better than yours. It's better than yours, it's better than yours I got a broomstick, it's better than yours. It's better than yours, wah-oh I got a broomstick, it's better than yours. It's better than yours, it's better than yours I got a broomstick, it's better than yours It's better than yours, wah-ohhhhh  You must have felt cool When McGonagall picked you the Seeker Do you feel like a fool Now that your broomstick is weaker? Yours is a Nimbus 2000, I've got a Three My broomstick makes yours look like Ron Weasley's We can beat you with our arms tied behind our back You can stick last year's House Cup up your crack.  'Cause I got a broomstick, it's better than yours. It's better than yours, it's better than yours I got a broomstick, it's better than yours It's better than yours, wah-oh  I got a broomstick, it's better than yours. It's better than yours, it's better than yours I got a broomstick, it's better than yours. It's better than yours, wah-ohhhh oh ohhhh, oh!

He never gave me the attention he gave Harry He never showed an interest in me I watched him from afar, wishing I had a scar So he would see the great wizard I could be  There was always a brightness dancing in his eye And a hint of laughter just below the calm I just couldn't do what the Dark Lord ordered me to I couldn't do the old man any harm   No, I couldn't kill Albus Dumbledore I couldn't kill Albus Dumbledore I couldn't kill Albus Dumbledore I couldn't kill him  Finally I had him at my mercy (Uh-huh) But I couldn't bring myself to kill the man I selected a path to face up to the wrath Of not meeting the Dark Lord's demands  'Cause I couldn't kill Albus Dumbledore No, I couldn't kill Albus Dumbledore I couldn't kill Albus Dumbledore No, I couldn't kill I said, I couldn't kill Albus Dumbledore

My dad's always there to open all my doors You have to call a Patronus just to catch a glimpse of yours My mom says she loves me when she tucks me into bed How's your mommy doing in the Mirror of Erised?  My dad is rich and your dad is dead My dad is rich and your dad is dead  Your dad's on his journey to the great beyond When you're dueling you might see him Come out of someone else's wand You may have freed our house-elf Or brought doubt to our family name But your parents still got toasted By a big green blowing flame!  My dad is rich and your dad is dead My dad is rich and your dad is dead  My dad is rich and your dad is dead My dad is rich and your dad is dead
